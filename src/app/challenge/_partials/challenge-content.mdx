# Growth Team Challenge

Chains Leaderboard

### Background:

Lava Protocol is a decentralised RPC access infrastructure that in a nutshell gives developers to
interact with rpc providers for different chains. After the developer paired with providers and
passed relays, the provider is reporting about the work that was done back to the blockchain
and ask for payment.

### The Task:

Build a web-app that show the top 10 chains on lava by the number of relays pass in Lava
Blockchain in the last 20 blocks.

Requirement:

- Sync data from the previous 20 blocks once the user load the screen
- Show the data in two columns:
  - Chain Name
  - Number of relays
- Watch for new blocks - Every new block, remove the oldest block in your data and
  update the table on the fly
  Guidelines:
- You may use any frontend framework you like (preferably React).
- You may use any UI Kit you like (Chakra/MUI/tailwind/etc...).
- No backend code is required.
- The code should be explained thoroughly with comments.
- Please include a Readme.md with your explanations and a walkthrough of how to run
  and participate.
- The project should be plug-and-play, without any extra configuration.

### Hints:

- Use gateway.lavanet.xyz to get API Access to Lava blockchain
- MsgRelayPayment is the relevant message on the transaction
  - Inside there are
    [relays](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/blob/5d3f1d5e2b3bf0b1dc2b4b7014cfb8c44d51b2ea/proto/pairing/tx.proto#LL66C14-L66C14)
    from type of
    [RelaySession](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/blob/5d3f1d5e2b3bf0b1dc2b4b7014cfb8c44d51b2ea/proto/pairing/relay.proto#LL14C13-L14C13)
    with relay_num property which holds the aggregated amount of relays in each payment transaction.
  - You have to decode the transaction from the block:
    - [see this tutorial for how to decode transactions](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/tutorials/7-cosmjs/2-first-steps.html)
    - [use LavaSDK to decode the MsgRelayPayment](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/tree/main/ecosystem/lava-sdk)
